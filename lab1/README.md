# ITMD441_Lab1

## Lab 1

### Overview
In this assignment, you will design and build a personal resume webpage using only **HTML** and **CSS** (no JavaScript).  
You will then host your page using **GitHub Pages** so it is publicly accessible.  

Both ITMD 441 students and ITMD 541 students will complete a resume site, but ITMD 541 students must meet additional requirements for **typography, semantic structure, responsive optimization, and professional-level styling**.

This project will give you experience with:
- HTML structure and styling  
- CSS layout (flexbox/grid encouraged)  
- Publishing a site using GitHub Pages  
- Creating a modern, professional webpage you can continue to use after the course  


### Your resume page must include:
1. **Header**
   - Your name (large, prominent)
   - Your desired role/title (e.g., *Aspiring Web Developer*)
   - Links to at least two contact methods (e.g., email, GitHub, LinkedIn)

2. **Summary Section**
   - A short career objective or personal introduction (2–3 sentences)

3. **Education Section**
   - Your current degree program and expected graduation date

4. **Skills Section**
   - A list of at least five skills (e.g., HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub, teamwork)

5. **Experience Section**
   - At least one job, internship, or relevant experience  
   *(academic projects count if you don’t have work experience)*

6. **Projects Section**
   - At least one project with:
     - Title  
     - Description  
     - Link (GitHub repo or live demo if available)

7. **Image Requirement**
   - At least one image must be used in the layout (e.g., professional headshot, project screenshot, or icon/illustration)
   - All images must include descriptive **alt text** for accessibility

8. **Footer**
   - Copyright notice with your name  
   - Statement that it is hosted on GitHub Pages  

### Technical Requirements
All Students must:
- Use only **HTML and CSS** (no JavaScript)
- Use CSS for layout and styling (**flexbox** or **grid** encouraged)
- Avoid browser default styling — all text elements (headings, paragraphs, links, lists) must be styled
- Ensure the page is **mobile-friendly** (readable on both desktop and mobile)
- Host publicly on **GitHub Pages** with the link submitted
- Commit to GitHub early and often — multiple, meaningful commits are expected throughout the development process, not just a single final commit
