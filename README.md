# ITMD441_-Lab1

## Lab 1
### Overview
In this assignment, you will design and build a personal resume webpage using only HTML and
CSS (no JavaScript). You will then host your page using GitHub Pages so it is publicly accessible.
Both ITMD 441 students and ITMD 541 students will complete a resume site, but ITMD 541
students must meet additional requirements for typography, semantic structure, responsive
optimization, and professional-level styling.

This project will give you experience with:
• HTML structure and styling
• CSS layout (flexbox/grid encouraged)
• Publishing a site using GitHub Pages
• Creating a modern, professional webpage you can continue to use after the course
Content Requirements

### Your resume page must include:
1. Header
o Your name (large, prominent)
o Your desired role/title (e.g., Aspiring Web Developer)
o Links to at least two contact methods (e.g., email, GitHub, LinkedIn)

2. Summary Section
o A short career objective or personal introduction (2–3 sentences)

3. Education Section
o Your current degree program and expected graduation date

4. Skills Section
o A list of at least five skills (e.g., HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub, teamwork)

5. Experience Section
o At least one job, internship, or relevant experience (academic projects count if
you don’t have work experience)

6. Projects Section
o At least one project with title, description, and a link (GitHub repo or live demo if
available)

7. Image Requirement
o At least one image must be used in the layout (e.g., a professional headshot,
project screenshot, or icon/illustration).
o All images must include descriptive alt text for accessibility.
8. Footer
o Copyright notice with your name
o Statement that it is hosted on GitHub Pages
### Technical Requirements
All Students:
• Use only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).
• Use CSS for layout and styling (flexbox or grid encouraged).
• No element should appear with browser default styling — all text elements (headings,
paragraphs, links, lists) must be styled.
• Page should be mobile-friendly (readable on both desktop and mobile).
• Hosted publicly on GitHub Pages with the link submitted.
• Commit to GitHub early and often — multiple, meaningful commits are expected
throughout the development process, not just a single final commit.
